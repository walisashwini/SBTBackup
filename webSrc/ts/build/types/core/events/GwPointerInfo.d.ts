     * Runs logic to determine if this instance of GwPointerInfo should replace a currently stored instance.

     * in a multi-touch environment. Like if the user is holding a tablet by the bottom left corner
     * We would start tracking that thumb touch, and then, without this logic, we would ignore every other touch
     * or pen touch that didn't match that touch's id.
     *
     * When this method runs, it attempts to do things like assume if a pen touch follows a finger touch, then we should
     * ignore the earlier finger touch.
     *
     * Or if the earlier touch was "large" in footprint, and a following touch was much smaller, then we'll assume
     * the earlier touch was the user placing their "palm" on a large tablet device. And we'll let a new touch, or a new
     * pen touch replace it.
     *
     * The more opinionated, latter half of the method's logic, can be disabled via the smartTouchRejection panel pref.

/**
 * How to construct an element on the server that responds to events:
 * 1. add data-gw-eventname="methodname", ie: '<div data-gw-click="fireEvent">'
 *   -
 *   - You can also pass a dot delimited string to use a method not on this.methods: ie:
 *     - data-gw-eventname="SouthPanel.UIMethods.toggleMinMax"
 * 2. Any additional arguments should be supplied after the method name and a space.
 *   - ie: <div data-gw-click="fireEvent add:class1 class2 class3 target:.class4">.
 *   - if you use an `argName: blah` format, then the client will build a map of argName to argString.
 *   - for the common methods, these are already defined. So addClass expects add: blah, etc.
 *     - for custom methods, it will call your method as myMethod(node, argumentMap, event);
 *   - If you want to pass custom info to a custom method and not use name: blah, just don't use any colons, and the client will execute
 *     your method as myMethod(node, entireArgString, event);
 *
 * Key event handling makes use of "key listener" objects. A key listener contains the description of
 * a key (a keyCode plus boolean modifiers, like alt, shift, ctrl), an optional enableDefault flag and
 * an action to execute. The action is either a simple method name, stored in a field called "methodName",
 * or a "createEventDescription" function that can be called to get a complete event description.

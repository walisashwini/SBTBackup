# Partials #
* Partials are NOT a required part of the themeing system. They are simply a convenient way to make reusable chunks of SASS
that can be imported into themes.
* NOTE: importing is not supported anywhere else in the GW SASS compilation. All files are automatically imported in a
specific order. Only importing partials directly into theme files is supported.
